# **JWT-Based Authentication System**
This project showcases a secure, stateless authentication system built with Spring Boot and JWT (JSON Web Tokens). 
It provides a foundational setup for implementing authentication and role-based access in web applications.

## Features

### Secure Authentication:
- Stateless user authentication using JWT.
- Encrypted passwords stored securely in the database.

### Access Token & Refresh Token: 
- Generate and manage both access and refresh tokens for secure session management.

### Role-Based Access:
- Define and enforce access controls for different roles like Admin and User.
- Custom Security Configuration:
- Fine-grained access to endpoints.
- Middleware for token validation.

### Scalable Design:
- Modular structure for easy integration into larger applications.

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT, MySQL
- Tools: Postman for API testing, Swagger for API documentation
  

## Installation

### Clone the repository:
- git clone [repository-link]

### Set up the backend:
- Configure application.properties with your database credentials.
- Run the Spring Boot application.

## Future Enhancements
- Add OAuth2 support for third-party authentication.
- Provide UI integration with popular frontend frameworks.
